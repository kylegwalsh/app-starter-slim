<guiding_principles>

- Clarity and Reuse: Every component and page should be modular and reusable. Avoid duplication by factoring repeated UI patterns into components.
- Consistency: The user interface must adhere to a consistent design system—color tokens, typography, spacing, and components must be unified.
- Simplicity: Favor small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity in styling or logic.
- Visual Quality: Follow the high visual quality bar as outlined in OSS guidelines (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.)

</guiding_principles>

<frontend_stack_defaults>

- Framework: Next.js (TypeScript)
- Styling: TailwindCSS v4
- UI Components: `@repo/design` (shadcn-based design system)
- Icons: Lucide
- State Management: tRPC + Tanstack Query (server data state) / Jotai (global state)
- Directory Structure:

  ```text
  /app                       # Next.js App Router
  /app/(authenticated)       # Protected routes & layouts
  /app/(unauthenticated)     # Public/auth routes & layouts
  /components/               # UI building blocks
  /components/providers/     # Providers (auth, query, theme)
  /components/initializers/  # Client initializers
  /core/                     # Client core (auth, trpc, storage)
  /hooks/                    # Reusable React hooks
  /atoms/                    # Jotai state atoms
  ```

<ui_ux_best_practices>

- Visual Hierarchy: Limit typography to 4–5 font sizes and weights for consistent hierarchy; use `text-xs` for captions and annotations; avoid `text-xl` unless for hero or major headings.
- Color Usage: Use 1 neutral base (e.g., `zinc`) and up to 2 accent colors.
- Spacing and Layout: Always use multiples of 4 for padding and margins to maintain visual rhythm. Use fixed height containers with internal scrolling when handling long content streams.
- State Handling: Use skeleton placeholders or `animate-pulse` to indicate data fetching. Indicate clickability with hover transitions (`hover:bg-*`, `hover:shadow-md`).
- Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where appropriate. Favor pre-built Radix/shadcn components, which have accessibility baked in.
