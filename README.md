## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed and configured:

- **Node.js** (recommend using nvm) - [Install guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
- **pnpm** (for package and monorepo management) — [Install guide](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- **gh** (GitHub CLI) — [Install guide](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
- **aws-cli** (AWS CLI) — [Install guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- **Docker** (for running a shadow DB for migrations) — [Install guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Initial Project Setup

Use this section when setting up the starter template for the first time or creating a new project.

> **Note:** The setup script works best if you already have a domain purchased and managed by AWS Route 53

#### 1. Install Base Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Run the Initialization Script

```sh
pnpm run init
```

This interactive script will guide you through configuring all the services and integrations:

- Verifies required CLIs are installed and authenticated (pnpm, gh, aws-cli)
- Prompts for your project name, environment name, and domain
- Ensures your repository is connected to GitHub
- Initializes AWS credentials and profile for deployment
- Guides you through setting up Supabase projects (production and development)
- Configures Better Auth for authentication
- Configures GitHub environments and secrets for CI/CD

### Working with an Existing Project

Use this section when joining an existing project or working on a codebase that's already been initialized.

#### 1. Install Current Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Set Up Your Environment

```sh
pnpm run init:existing
```

This interactive script will guide you through the setup of your local environment.

---

## Running Locally

After completing the setup, you can start developing and testing your apps locally.

### Start All Apps

```sh
pnpm start
```

This command will:

- Launch the Next.js frontend (`apps/web`)
- Start the backend using SST locally (`apps/backend`)
- Connect to your Supabase database
- Generate any required types and assets

> All core services will be up and running, connected, and ready for development.

---

## Deployment

Deployments are managed using SST and AWS, with automated workflows powered by GitHub Actions.

### Deploy to AWS

```sh
pnpm run deploy
```

This will:

- Deploy your serverless backend and infrastructure using SST
- Sync environment variables and secrets as configured during setup

### Continuous Integration & Delivery

GitHub Actions handle all CI/CD workflows, supporting testing and deployments across multiple environments.

#### Current Workflow (Rapid Development)

Optimized for small projects and quick iteration:

**Main Branch:**

- Every push triggers linting and basic tests
- Auto-deploys to `dev` environment on test success

**Production Releases:**

- Create a GitHub release to deploy to production
- Runs full test suite plus E2E tests in temporary `ci` environment
- Deploys to `production` environment after all tests pass

_Environments: `dev`, `prod`_

#### Proposed Workflow (Larger Projects)

For projects requiring stricter quality gates:

**Branch Protection:**

- Trunk requires PR approval and passing tests
- Merge queue ensures code compatibility before landing

**Pull Requests:**

- Trigger linting, basic tests, and builds
- Must pass review before merging

**Release Process:**

- `releases/*` branches auto-deploy to `staging` with full E2E testing
- GitHub releases from release branches deploy to `prod`

_Environments: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`_

---

## Helper Tasks

- **Create a New Package:**  
  Scaffold a new package with the following command:

  ```sh
  pnpm create:package <package-name>
  ```

  Or use the VSCode Tasks UI:  
  `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Create New Package"  
  You can also use the templates in the `templates/` directory to quickly scaffold new apps or packages.

- **Add Backend Environment Variables:**  
  To add environment variables to the backend, run:

  ```sh
  pn backend add-secret
  ```

  This will start a helper script that guides you through securely adding secrets to your backend environment.

---

## Testing

This monorepo is set up for robust testing of both backend and frontend applications, with minimal mocking to ensure high-quality, realistic test results.

### Backend

- **Test Runner:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Database:** In-memory SQLite
- **Purpose:** We use Vitest to run integration tests against the actual backend routes and tRPC endpoints. The backend is tested with a real in-memory SQLite database (serves as a mock database), so you can verify the full behavior of your API with minimal mocking. This approach ensures that your tests are as close to production as possible, catching issues that might be missed with heavy mocking.

**How to run backend tests:**

```sh
pnpm backend test
```

> This runs all tests for the backend app.

You can also run the Vitest UI for interactive test running:

```sh
pnpm backend test:ui
```

### Web

- **E2E Tests:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

#### Basic Tests

- **Test Runner:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Purpose:** We use Vitest to run basic tests against complicated utilities and functions in the web codebase. This is helpful for ensuring that complicated units of code behave as expected.

**How to run frontend basic tests:**

```sh
pnpm web test
```

> This runs all Vitest basic tests for the web app.

For the interactive UI:

```sh
pnpm web test:ui
```

#### E2E Tests

- **Test Runner:** [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- **Purpose:** We use Playwright, which launches a real browser to test your app end-to-end. This helps ensure that the app works as expected from end to end for important user flows.

**How to run frontend E2E tests:**

```sh
pnpm web test:e2e
```

> This runs all Playwright E2E tests for the web app.

For the Playwright UI (to run/debug tests interactively):

```sh
pnpm web test:e2e:ui
```
